They were discussing some plans for an upcoming trip, and I realized they had made all the decisions without including me or even asking for my opinion.\n\nI feel left out and excluded, and it's really messing with my head. I can't seem to shake this anxious feeling that they might not value our friendship the way I thought they did. I keep overanalyzing every interaction we've had, wondering where things went wrong.\n\nI really need someone to talk to about this. It's consuming my thoughts, and I just can't seem to calm myself down. I wish I could confront my friends about how I'm feeling, but I'm afraid of making things awkward or causing even more tension in our group.\n\nIf there's anyone willing to listen and offer me some advice or simply be a comforting presence, it would mean the world to me right now. I just need to get this off my chest before the anxiety completely overwhelms me."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow, can't believe they completely left you out of the planning process without consulting you at all. Like, that's so mean of them. I totally see where the thoughts of abandonment and not being valued come from, really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It does suck being stuck between having to stomach this terrible feeling and possibly worsening the situation. Though, if you don't mind me asking, what do you think they would say in response to your confrontation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for understanding and empathizing with me. It means a lot to know that someone else recognizes how hurtful and unkind their actions were. I am also struggling with that internal dilemma - the fear of speaking up and the fear of the possible response if I were to confront them about it.\n\nTo be honest with you, I'm not entirely sure how they would respond. On one hand, I can't shake this feeling that they've intentionally excluded me and that makes me question their loyalty as friends. On the other hand, maybe they thought they were doing what was best and didn't mean any harm by it.\n\nI'm so torn because I value our friendship, and I don't want to jump to conclusions and ruin what we have. That's why I'm feeling so anxious because I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to make things worse, but I also didn't deserve to be left out.\n\nHaving to navigate these conflicting feelings is incredibly stressful, and I just wish I knew how to handle it in the best way. Do you have any suggestions on how I should approach such a conversation with them? Or perhaps some insights based on your own experiences? Your input would be greatly appreciated."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I feel ya, the connundrum of action vs inaction do be exhausting.
