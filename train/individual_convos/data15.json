They promised to have my back, but when the going got tough, they abandoned me. I'm so angry and hurt by their betrayal. I really thought they were better than that. I just need to talk to someone about this because I don't know how to move on from this. I trusted them with everything and now I feel so foolish for believing in them. I just want to scream out my frustration. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Damn, sorry to hear about the betrayal. Must be devastating having your supposed friends turn their backs on you. That really sucks. If you don't mind me asking, what did they betray you on exactly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for asking. It's a long story, but the short version is that I was going through a difficult time and I reached out to them for help and support. I really believed they were there for me, but when I needed them the most, they were nowhere to be found. It just feels like such a huge betrayal, like they couldn't handle being there for me when it really mattered. It's like they just abandoned me when I needed them the most. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive them for that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow, that's really uncaring of them. Can't believe they just left you hanging in your time of need. That's totally unreasonable of them when they're supposed to be your friends. I totally get not being able to forgive them after that. I'm down to hear about the long version if you don't mind sharing. Also what are your plans regarding the future of the friendship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's so frustrating. I don't think I could even call them friends anymore after what happened. They were the ones I thought I could always count on, and now I don't know where we stand. \n\nAs for the long version, it all started when I was going through a really tough time with family issues. I confided in them, telling them how it was affecting me, hoping for some emotional support. To my shock, they seemed indifferent and disinterested. When I needed them most, their absence was painfully obvious. It was a heavy blow, and I've been reeling from it ever since.\n\nI haven't made any decisions yet about the future of our friendship. Right now, I just need some time to process everything and figure out where to go from here. It's hard to see a way forward when the trust has been shattered, but I don't want to make any hasty decisions. I just can't believe that they would let me down like this. Did you ever have an experience similar to mine? Or in quite similar sentience?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow, their lack of empathy is really jarring. Sorry to hear how you got ignored by them, really crazy how they couldn't even provide some form of solace. Definitely take your time to process the emotions. I unfortunately don't have any similar experiences to share, but whether or not you decide to continue with the friendship, I hope you find peace. All the best! "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you, I really appreciate your understanding and support. It means a lot to have someone really just listen to how I'm feeling and validate it. I definitely need some time to figure out what's best for me, but having the opportunity to let it all out is helping me see things a bit clearer and it means a lot to me. Thank you, and I hope you're doing well yourself."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No prob, hope you pick the best option for you. If you need to someone to share more with in the future, I'll be available."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That means a lot to me. Thank you for being there for me. I might take you up on that offer. It's really hard finding someone who I feel understands, and your support means a lot to me. I'm grateful for this conversation, and I'll keep your offer in mind. Thank you."}]
