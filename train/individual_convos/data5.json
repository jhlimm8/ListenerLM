I am so beyond irritated right now. They just don't understand me at all, and it's like talking to a brick wall. I tried to express my feelings and be vulnerable with them, but all they did was shut me down and invalidate my emotions.\n\nI'm just so sick of the lack of communication and empathy in my family. It feels like I'm constantly surrounded by people who don't know how to listen or understand where I'm coming from. It's like I'm on my own island of frustration, and it's starting to take a toll on me.\n\nI need someone to talk to about this. I need to vent and get some outside perspective on how to deal with this constant cycle of anger and resentment in my family. Can you listen and maybe offer some advice on how to navigate this situation?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow, can't believe they would be so insensitive, especially to someone's that's trying to be vulnerable. Sure i can listen, but I don't really have much advice to give. If you don't mind me asking though, what did you share with them, and how did they shut you down exactly? "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's frustrating to open up to them and have them be so dismissive of my feelings. I tried to explain the impact their actions were having on me and even gave specific examples of when I felt hurt or ignored. Instead of acknowledging my perspective, they just brushed it off as overreacting and making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nIt's like they don't even want to listen or have any empathy for how I'm feeling. I honestly feel like I'm running out of options on how to connect with them emotionally.\n\nI appreciate you being willing to listen, even if you don't have much advice to give. Just having someone to share this with does help. Thank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That does sound extremely annoying, having people you care about completely shrug off your heartfelt feelings, especially when you put in the effort to specifically refer to individual cases. Really sorry that you have to go through this. If you don't mind me asking, what are some of the examples where you felt hurt or ignored?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I remember one specific instance when I was really excited to share something important with my family, like a big decision that I made. I gathered my courage to open up to them, but instead of encouraging me or showing interest, they acted disinterested and started talking about something completely unrelated. It was hurtful because it felt like they didn't even care about what I was sharing or how it made me feel.\n\nIn other situations, when I expressed a vulnerability or raised a concern, the response was always dismissive, as if I was just being overly sensitive about things. It's like they don't take my emotions seriously at all. It's a pattern that's been going on for so long, and I'm at a breaking point.\n\nI just want to have a family where I feel like my feelings are valued and respected. Is that too much to ask for?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Damn, that does sound extremely neglectful and uncaring. The lack of acknowledgement and concern must be a horrible feeling. Sorry to hear that this has been a long-standing problem, and you're definitely valid for wanting a family that actually cares for you. Do you have any plans on what you're gonna do next?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Honestly, I'm not even sure what to do next. I've tried to approach the situation from different angles, I've tried to explain how their behavior impacts me, but it's like talking to a brick wall. Part of me feels like giving up and just accepting that this is the way it's always going to be.\n\nBut then another part of me doesn't want to settle for that. I keep hoping that things might change if I keep trying to communicate my feelings and set boundaries. But it's getting so exhausting, and I'm starting to think that maybe it's time to detach myself from the situation and focus on building a support system that understands and validates me.\n\nSo, I guess my plan now is to take care of myself, work on building relationships outside of my family, and try to distance myself from the negative impact of their lack of consideration. It's just disheartening to even think about having to do that, but I feel like it's necessary for my own well-being.\n\nThanks for listening and offering support. It's been really comforting to have someone show genuine understanding."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Welp, whether you end up trying again to get them to acknowledge you or focus on self-improvement, I hope you find success in your endeavour.
