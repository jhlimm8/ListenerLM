I recently went through a really tough experience with my partner and it's been weighing heavily on me.

The experience was related to a significant decision that we needed to make together, something that deeply affected us both.

It left me feeling unheard and made me question the strength of our relationship.\n\nI wish I could understand why they are not willing to talk about it. Maybe they feel overwhelmed and are unable to process their own feelings about the situation. Or maybe they just have a totally different perspective and don't see the need to delve into it any further.\n\nIt really tears me apart that they seem unavailable with matters that concern both of us, I could really use some empathy at this moment.

I am hoping that by expressing my emotions and concerns without escalating, they might be more willing to understand and work through the situation together.\n\nUltimately, I want to come to a resolution or at least to a greater understanding of each other, to maintain the strength and connection that our relationship once had.
