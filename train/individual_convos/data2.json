I am so angry about it and I need to talk to someone before I explode. They promised me they would prioritize spending time with me this weekend, but instead they ditched me for their friends yet again. I feel completely disrespected and unvalued. How can they keep treating me like this? I need to figure out what to do because I can't hold this anger inside any longer. Can someone please help me process this before I confront them?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Wow, that's really terrible of them to do so. Can't believe they abandoned you and lied to you about the promise. What an asshole! You mentioned \"yet again\", does that mean they've done this multiple times now?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, exactly. It's not the first time they have canceled plans or prioritized their friends over me. Every time we make plans, it feels like I'm constantly being put on the backburner for something else. It's making me question their priorities and whether they truly care about our relationship. I'm just so sick of feeling neglected and unimportant. I deserve better than this constant disappointment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, sounds like they're definitely not taking their promises with you seriously. Must be infuriating being constantly blown off by someone you care about, who you would assume also cares about you. Have you talked to them about this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have tried talking to them about it, but it always ends up with them making excuses and it turns into an argument. They don't seem to fully understand how much their actions hurt me, or they just don't care. I feel like I'm at a point where I'm not even sure if I want to continue trying to make this relationship work. I'm just so angry and hurt, and I don't know if I can keep going through this cycle of disappointment. It's exhausting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can't believe they don't even try to empathize and acknowledge your perspective. Breaking one's promises is such an obvious wrongdoing. Sorry to hear about the resulting suffering and pain you've experienced, hope you can manage to feel better soon. As to whether to continue the relationship or what to do otherwise, hope you can find a decision that brings you peace."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for your support. I really appreciate it. It's just so frustrating not being able to count on someone I care about. I'll take some time to really think about what's best for me. It's just difficult because I still love them, but this situation is taking a toll on me. Your understanding means a lot to me."}]
