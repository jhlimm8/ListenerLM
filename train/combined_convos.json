It took the temptation to spend out of the equation.\n\nAlso, I made an effort to look for areas where I could cut costs and make savings without compromising on my happiness. Small changes like cooking at home more often, cutting down on unnecessary subscriptions, or finding cheaper alternatives for everyday purchases added up to substantial savings over time.\n\nI'd love to hear if you have any strategies that have worked for you when it comes to saving money or reaching financial goals!

Thanks for listening."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, that really is mean of them to just completely ignore your worries like that. Can't believe they aren't willing to just answer questions. The absolute lack of empathy sounds extremely annoying. Unfortunate that you have to put with it given the lack of options. Do you have any plans on talking to them about it? "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm hesitant to confront the doctor because I already feel dismissed and I'm afraid it will only make things worse. I'm considering finding a second opinion with a different health care provider to get the answers I need. It's disheartening to think about having to go through the process all over again, but I can't continue feeling unheard and neglected when it comes to my health. It's also affecting my emotional well-being, and that's not something to take lightly. Thank you for your understanding, and for allowing me to vent about this frustrating experience."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No probs! Best of luck in finding a new provider, and hopefully they'll be more accomodating of your perspective, unlike your current doctor. All the best!"}]}]
